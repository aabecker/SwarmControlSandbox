\maketitle

\begin{abstract}Micro robots are suited for targeted drug delivery and micro scale manufacturing because they are small enough to navigate the passageways of the body. However, due to their small size, micro robots cannot contain onboard processing for autonomy nor onboard power. Instead they are controlled by an external signal such as a magnetic field. Because each robot can only provide a small amount of force or transport a small amount of material, large swarms of robots are required, all controlled by the same external field.

Manipulating objects with a swarm of simple robots with global control inputs is difficult because they are highly under-actuated, the number of robots in contact with object changes dynamically, the robots contacting each other changes dynamically, and because the robots disperse over time they must be recollected.
This work presents controllers and algorithms for steering such an under-actuated swarm to manipulate objects. Previous work showed that mean and variance of the swarm is controllable. This was used to manipulate convex polygonal objects through a simple maze. A key remaining challenge is controlling the torque applied to an object. Torque control is necessary for manipulating objects as well as for aligning sensors, emitters, or redirecting an incoming signal. This work first proves that swarm torque control is possible, then presents algorithms to automate the task. The paper concludes with experimental results using 97 hardware robots to manipulate rectangles with large aspect ratios.

%Micro- and nano-robots can be manufactured in large numbers. Large numbers of micro robots are required in order to deliver sufficient payloads, but the small size of these robots makes it difficult to perform onboard computation.  Instead, these robots are often controlled by a global, broadcast signal. 
%In our previous work we focused on a block-pushing task, where a swarm of robots pushed a larger block through a 2D maze. One surprising result was that humans that only knew the swarm's mean and covariance completed the task faster that humans who knew the position of every robot~\cite{Becker2013b}. 
%Inspired by that work, we proved that we can control the mean position of a swarm and that with an obstacle we can control the swarm's position variance ($\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$). 
%We then wrote automatic controllers which could complete a block pushing task, but these controllers had some limitations~\cite{ShahrokhiIROS2015}. 
%One of the limitations was that we could only compress our swarm along the world $x$ and $y$ axes, and could not navigate workspaces with narrow corridors with other orientations. 
%One solution to these problems would be a controller that regulates the swarm's position covariance, $\sigma_{xy}$. 
%For controlling $\sigma_{xy}$, we prove that the swarm position covariance $\sigma_{xy}$ is controllable given boundaries with non-zero friction. 
%We then prove that two orthogonal boundaries with high friction are sufficient to arbitrarily position a swarm of robots. 
%We conclude by designing controllers that efficiently regulate $\sigma_{xy}$.
