\section{My \emph{Objectives} this week: Optimal Solution for the algorithm for two robots positioning using friction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Write down the code of optimal solution.
\end{itemize}



\section{My \emph{Accomplishments} this week}


\begin{itemize}
\item If it is reachable in one move is written and it is debugged and errors has been corrected. It works.
\item If it is reachable in 3 moves, the algorithm chooses the right move for the first two moves if the robot is top most and left most. I corrected the errors for this part as well. It still needs more debugging.
\item The rotations are NOT correct.
\end{itemize}


\section{My \emph{Plan} for next week}

\begin{itemize}
\item make sure the 3 move works for all the cases.
\item make the rotations work correctly.
\item complete the algorithm so that it also considers the not achievable sets.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Meeting with Dr. Becker  }

\begin{itemize}
\item Nothing to mention. I will give my progress report in my next meeting. 
\end{itemize}
