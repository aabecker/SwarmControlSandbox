\begin{abstract}
Swarms of micro and nano robots take advantage of the power of volume to achieve, otherwise unfeasible for individual robots, tasks such as targeted drug delivery and micro scale manufacturing. However, due to their minuscule size, micro robots cannot contain onboard processing for autonomy nor onboard power. One solution is to control the micro robots with an external signal, our global variable input, such as a magnetic field. The main challenges to controlling a swarm of robots with only global control inputs are the swarm?s under-actuated characteristic, the fluctuating number of robots in contact with the object and with other robots, and the robot?s tendency to separate from the swarm. Addressing the challenges stated above, this work presented controllers and algorithms for steering such a swarm to manipulate objects. Previous work showed that by controlling the mean and variance of the swarm, the swarm can manipulate convex polygonal objects through a simple maze. The remaining key challenge in object manipulation with a swarm is torque control. In addition to manipulating objects, torque control is also necessary for aligning sensors and emitters, and redirecting incoming signals. This work proved that swarms can execute torque control and presented algorithms to automate the use of torque control. Included in this paper, our experiments showed a swarm of 97 robots successfully manipulating rectangles by using autonomous torque control.

%Micro- and nano-robots can be manufactured in large numbers. Large numbers of micro robots are required in order to deliver sufficient payloads, but the small size of these robots makes it difficult to perform onboard computation.  Instead, these robots are often controlled by a global, broadcast signal. 
%In our previous work we focused on a block-pushing task, where a swarm of robots pushed a larger block through a 2D maze. One surprising result was that humans that only knew the swarm's mean and covariance completed the task faster that humans who knew the position of every robot~\cite{Becker2013b}. 
%Inspired by that work, we proved that we can control the mean position of a swarm and that with an obstacle we can control the swarm's position variance ($\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$). 
%We then wrote automatic controllers which could complete a block pushing task, but these controllers had some limitations~\cite{ShahrokhiIROS2015}. 
%One of the limitations was that we could only compress our swarm along the world $x$ and $y$ axes, and could not navigate workspaces with narrow corridors with other orientations. 
%One solution to these problems would be a controller that regulates the swarm's position covariance, $\sigma_{xy}$. 
%For controlling $\sigma_{xy}$, we prove that the swarm position covariance $\sigma_{xy}$ is controllable given boundaries with non-zero friction. 
%We then prove that two orthogonal boundaries with high friction are sufficient to arbitrarily position a swarm of robots. 
%We conclude by designing controllers that efficiently regulate $\sigma_{xy}$.
