\section{Block-Pushing Results}\label{sec:exp}

This section analyzes a \emph{block-pushing} task attempted by both our hybrid, hysteresis-based controller and by human users.  

\subsection{Human-Controlled Block-Pushing}



As we saw in previous section, players with just the mean completed the task faster than those with full-state feedback.  As Fig.~\ref{fig:ResVaryVis} shows, the levels of feedback arranged by increasing completion time are [mean, mean + variance, full-state, convex-hull].  Interviews with  beta-testers suggests that tracking 100 robots was overwhelming---similar to schooling phenomenons that confuse predators---while working with just the mean + variance was like using a ``spongy'' manipulator. Convex-hull feedback was confusing and irritating because a single robot left behind an obstacle would distort the entire hull, obscuring the information about the majority of the swarm.
%obscuring what the rest of the swarm is doing.   


\subsection{Automated Block-Pushing}
Fig.~\ref{fig:story} shows snapshots during an execution of this algorithm. To solve this block-pushing task, we discretized the environment. On this discretized grid we used breadth-first search to determine $\mathbf{M}$, the shortest distance from any grid cell to the goal, and generated a gradient map $\nabla \mathbf{M}$ toward the goal as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BFSGradient}.  The block's center of mass is at $\mathbf{b}$ and has radius $r_b$. 
Three constants are needed, where $k_1>k_2>1$ and $1>k_2>0$. All experiments used $[k_1,k_2,k_3] = [2.5,1.5,0.1]$.
The robots were directed to assemble behind the block at  $\mathbf{b} - k_2 r_b \nabla \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{b})$, then move to  $\mathbf{b} - k_3 r_b \nabla \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{b})$ to push the block toward the goal location. We use the hybrid hysteresis-based controller in Alg.~\ref{alg:MeanVarianceControl}  to track the desired position, while maintaining sufficient robot density to move a block by switching to minimize variance whenever variance exceeds a set limit. The minimize variance control law \eqref{eq:PDcontrolVariance} is slightly modified to choose the nearest corner further from the goal than $\mathbf{b}$ with an obstacle-free straight-line path to $\mathbf{b}$. 
The control algorithm  for block-pushing is listed in Alg.~\ref{alg:BlockPushing}. 
Experimental results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:AutoControlVaryN}.  Although larger populations of robots can apply more force, minimizing the variance requires more time with larger populations and dominates task completion time.

Algorithm \ref{alg:BlockPushing} is an imperfect solution and has a failure mode if the robot swarm becomes multi-modal with modes separated by an obstacle, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Failure}.  In this case, moving toward a corner will never reduce the variance below $\sigma_{min}^2$.


  The first challenge is to identify when the distribution has become multi-modal.  Measuring just the mean and variance is insufficient to determine if a distribution is no longer unimodal, but if the swarm is being directed to a corner, and the variance does not reduce below $\sigma_{min}^2$, the swarm has become separated. In this case, we must either manipulate with a partial swarm, or run a gathering algorithm.  For the  `{\sffamily S}'-shaped workspace in this study, an open-loop input that commands the swarm to move in succession \{{\sc left, down, right, down}\} will move the swarm to the bottom right corner.
This is not true for all obstacle fields. In a  `{\sffamily T}'-shaped workspace, it is not possible to find an open-loop input that will move the entire swarm to the bottom of the `{\sffamily T}'.  
 
  Using only the mean and variance may be overly restrictive.  Many heuristics using high-order moments have been developed to test if a distribution is multimodal~\cite{haldane1951simple}.  Often the sensor data itself, though it may not resolve individual robots, will indicate multi-modality.  For instance CCD images reveal clusters of bacteria, and MRI scans show agglomerations of particles~\cite{stuber2007positive}.  This data can be fitted with $k$-means or expectation maximization algorithms, and manipulation could be performed with the nearest swarm of sufficient size.
